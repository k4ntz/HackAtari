      HackAtari is a wrapper around the OCAtari environments available in gymnasium. 
      It allows you to play altered versions of the Atari games.
      It alters the RAM of the game to create novel game dynamics, allowing for a wide range of variations.
      HackAtari environments also allow for object-centric Reinforcement Learning, as it is built upon `OC_Atari <https://github.com/k4ntz/OC_Atari>`_ .
      OCAtari automatically extracts the objects that exists in the state, 
      either via looking up their attribute in the RAM (fast), or using vision processing methods.
